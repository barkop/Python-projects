This was my second python project. I focused on clustering techniques. Main goal was to perform Customer segmentation based on their interests for marketing purposes.
As a dataset I used information included in ‘Speed Dating Experiment’ dataset from Kaggle.com. During project i learned about KMeans algorithm and PCA.
It Was also my first encounter with visualizations librares: matplotlib, plotly, seaborn.
